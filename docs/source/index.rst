Welcome to cvehunter documentation!
===================================

**CVEHunter** is a Python asynchronous library designed to simplify the retrieval of CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) information using the `NVD API <https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities>`_. It streamlines the process of searching for and accessing valuable security data for vulnerability assessment and management.
